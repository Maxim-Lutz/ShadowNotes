# ShadowNotes

ShadowNotes is a simple, CLI-based encrypted note-taking application built in Python. It allows users to securely create, read, update, and delete notes stored in a binary file format using AES encryption via the `cryptography` library.

## Features
- **Secure Encryption:** Each note is encrypted with AES-256 using a user-provided password.
- **Markdown Support:** Write your notes in Markdown format.
- **Local Storage:** All notes are stored locally as separate `.enc` files.
- **Command-Line Interface (CLI):** Manage your notes using simple commands.
- **Future Expansion:** Easily extendable to add a GUI or mobile version later on.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd ShadowNotes
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   # On Windows:
   .\venv\Scripts\activate
   # On macOS/Linux:
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Adding a Note
Run the following command to add a new note:
```bash
python src/main.py add "Your note content in **Markdown**"
```
You will be prompted to enter a password. The note will be encrypted and saved as a `.enc` file in the `notes/` directory.

### Reading a Note
To read a note, run:
```bash
python src/main.py read <filename.enc>
```
Replace `<filename.enc>` with the actual file name that was generated when the note was added. Enter the same password you used during encryption.

## Building the Application

You can build a standalone executable using [PyInstaller](https://pyinstaller.org/).

### For Windows:
1. **Install PyInstaller:**
   ```bash
   pip install pyinstaller
   ```

2. **Build the executable:**
   ```bash
   pyinstaller --onefile src/main.py
   ```

3. The compiled executable will be located in the `dist/` folder.

A sample build script (`build.bat`) is provided below to automate the process on Windows.

## Future Plans
- Add support for updating and deleting notes.
- Develop a graphical user interface (GUI) version.
- Integrate optional cloud synchronization with a self-hosted backend.

**Build Script (build.bat):**

Create a file named `build.bat` in your project root with the following content:

```batch
@echo off
echo Building ShadowNotes...
pyinstaller --onefile src/main.py
echo Build complete. The executable is located in the dist folder.
pause
```

---

### How to Use the Build Script

1. Make sure your virtual environment is activated.
2. Run the build script in your command prompt or PowerShell:
   ```powershell
   .\build.bat
   ```
3. After the script finishes, navigate to the `dist` folder to find your standalone executable.

This setup should give you a clear starting point for developing and distributing ShadowNotes on desktop. If you have any questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!
